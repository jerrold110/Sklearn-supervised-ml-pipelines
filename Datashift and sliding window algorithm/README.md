# Sklearn supervised ml pipelines
 Creating machine learning pipelines involving the whole process of a supervised machine learning model. The processes include feature transformation, feature selection, model fitting, and hyperparameter tuning. I also experiment with determining optimal training data moving window sizes to simulate chamption selection and retraining of a model in a production environment to accomodate datashift.
