## Sklearn supervised ml pipelines
 Creating machine learning pipelines involving the whole various machine learning workflows and saving them as binary objects that can be imported and used to make predictions in a server environment.

 ### Classification
 - Titanic dataset.
 - Fill missing 
 - Transformation, selection, model fitting, and hyperparameter tuning. 
 
 The training data window sizes determine an optimal window size on a sliding window of incoming data to retrain the model to accomodate datashift in a production environment.
