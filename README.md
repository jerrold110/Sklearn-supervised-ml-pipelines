## Sklearn supervised ml pipelines
 Creating machine learning pipelines involving building the various steps in the machine learning workflow and saving them as binary objects that can be imported and used to make predictions in a server environment. I do this with a classification and regression problem to demonstrate various steps in the modelling process and create a Pipeline object with a .fit() method.

 ### Classification
 - Titanic dataset.
 - Fill missing 
 - Transformation, selection, model fitting, and hyperparameter tuning. 

 ### Regression
 - California housing dataset.
 - Imputation, One hot encoding, Scaling
 - Dimensional reduction
 - Target variable transformation, model fitting
 
 ### Training window size
 The training data window sizes determine an optimal window size on a sliding window of incoming data. This window size is used to retrain the model to accomodate datashift if it occurs in production.
