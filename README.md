# Sklearn supervised ml pipelines
 Creating machine learning pipelines involving the whole process of a supervised machine learning model. 
 
 These projects feature transformation, selection, model fitting, and hyperparameter tuning. 
 
 The training data window sizes determine an optimal window size on a sliding window of incoming data to retrain the model to accomodate datashift in a production environment.
